		<h1>About us</h1>
	
			<p style="size:20px;">
				Newsports was started in 2018 with a vision to make intresting posts about the latest tech story. We live 
				in the small 
				city from where we post to our awesome readers out there and then start collecting the positive feedbacks. 
				It dosen't matter 
				even if we get negative comments as we know its just a act of taking things and acting in 
				a positive way rather than creating hate towards eachother
